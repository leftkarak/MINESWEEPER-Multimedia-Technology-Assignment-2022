# Minesweeper-Multimedia-Technology-Assignment-2022
A university project to develope the game Minesweeper with few modifications. Key modifications include the introduction of a "super-mine," adjustable mine quantities within difficulty limits, and a countdown timer. The project was implemented using Java. Note: UI is the terminal and the project still contains some minor bugs.
