This repository contains a university project. The [assigment](https://github.com/leftkarak/Minesweeper-Multimedia-Technology-Assignment-2022/tree/main/Assigment) as given by our Multimedia Technology course professor.

A university (NTUA, School of ECE, Multimedia Technology course) project to develope the game Minesweeper with few modifications. Key modifications include the introduction of a "super-mine," adjustable mine quantities within difficulty limits, and a countdown timer. 

The project was implemented using Java. Note: UI is the terminal and the project still contains some minor bugs.
